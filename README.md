Not much to say, this is the repo for my site. It's built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), with the [Congo theme](https://github.com/jpanther/congo). If you have any doubts with this repo, refer to the [original documentation](https://jpanther.github.io/congo/docs/) for better understanding my mess ❤️
