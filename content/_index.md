I'm Leonardo, I'm 20 and I'm an **Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science** student at [**Sapienza**](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/) in Rome.

I'm a passionate photographer and traveler, and I try to keep the memories of my trips within the art of photography.

In the year 2020/2021 I attended to an abroad year in Belgium with AFS.

After returning I became an AFS Volunteer. Thanks to that experience, I'm now able to speak 3 languages: Italian, English and Dutch. I've been a scout (both in Italy and in Belgium) for a total of 10 years.
