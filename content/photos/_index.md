In this page I want to share some of the **photos** I've taken so far, and of which I'm particularly proud. While they may not seem the most interesting stuff out there (I'm just an amateur in the field anyway), I like to cherish this little hobby of mine. All of these photos have been taken with my **Nikon D80**, and nothing else (eventually, a better camera will take the role of my beloved Nikon). I hope you'll enjoy them
