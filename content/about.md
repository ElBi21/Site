I'm Leonardo, I'm 21 and I'm an **Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science** student at [**Sapienza**](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/) in Rome. During these three years I explored a lot of Computer Science fields, and settles my main interests in the **High Performance Computing** (HPC) and **low level** fields.

I'm a passionate **photographer** and traveler, and I try to keep the memories of my trips within the art of photography.

In the year 2020/2021 I attended to an abroad year in Belgium with AFS. After returning I became an AFS Volunteer. Thanks to that experience, I'm now able to speak 3 languages: Italian, English and Dutch. I've been a scout (both in Italy and in Belgium) for a total of 10 years.
